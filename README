My .vimrc file created based on Martin 's talk "Vim as a Python IDE": https://github.com/mbrochh/vim-as-a-python-ide

It uses Vundle to manage plugins.


I made a modification to the python-mode plugin, python-mode/autoload/pymode/doc.vim to fix an error.

On line 13, I changed it to:
         py vim.current.buffer.append(out.encode('utf8').split('\n'), 0)
